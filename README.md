# Proteus: Computational Methods and Simulation Toolkit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cekees/proteus.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/cekees/proteus) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/erdc/proteus_tutorial/master?filepath=index.ipynb)  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/2212385.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/2212385)


Proteus (http://proteustoolkit.org) is a Python package for
rapidly developing computer models and numerical methods.

# Installation

## conda / mamba

```bash
mamba install proteus -c conda-forge
```

## conda / mamba for proteus development

For a development installation, you want to install Proteus's dependencies and compile Proteus from source. Two dependency files are provided, differing only in which MPI implementation they use -- see "Choosing between OpenMPI and MPICH" below. If in doubt, use the OpenMPI one:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment-openmpi-dev.yml # or environment-mpich-dev.yml; environment-dev-up.yml to try unpinned dependencies
mamba activate proteus-dev-openmpi              # or proteus-dev-mpich
# --no-build-isolation: without it pip builds in a throwaway environment and
# re-fetches build dependencies from PyPI, so proteus's extensions compile
# against PyPI numpy's headers while linking this env's numpy at runtime
# (visible as -I/tmp/pip-build-env-*/overlay/.../numpy/_core/include in the
# compile lines). The env already provides setuptools/cython/numpy/pybind11.
pip install --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir -v -e .
```

## conda / mamba with updated/unpinned dependencies

`environment-openmpi-dev.yml`/`environment-mpich-dev.yml` pin conda-forge
builds of everything proteus links against (PETSc, MPI, HDF5,
SuperLU/SuperLU_DIST, METIS/ParMETIS, Chrono, PUMI, Triangle/TetGen,
xtensor, ...), so this is the path to use if you want the optional Chrono
(multibody/FSI) and PUMI (mesh adaptation) support built in. Both
intentionally exclude the `defaults` channel (`nodefaults`) -- conda-forge
alone resolves everything here, and `defaults` pulls in `repo.anaconda.com`,
a commercial channel with its own Terms of Service and registration-gated
rate limits.

### Choosing between OpenMPI and MPICH

The two files are identical except for the MPI provider (and the build-string
wildcard on every MPI-linked package: `hdf5`, `h5py`, `scorec`, `zoltan`).

- **`environment-openmpi-dev.yml` (default/recommended).** Pins OpenMPI
  5.0.10. Known caveat: OpenMPI is not fork()-safe, so running the *entire*
  test suite in one process via `pytest --forked` can produce spurious
  SIGSEGV crashes in unrelated test files (an artifact of forking after MPI
  is initialized, not a proteus bug) -- run test files individually, or with
  `pytest-xdist` using separate worker processes, if you hit this.
- **`environment-mpich-dev.yml`.** Pins MPICH 5.0.1. On Linux aarch64 this is
  currently the *only* mpich version that works at all: conda-forge's scorec
  build there requires `mpich>=5.0,<6.0a0`, and of the two aarch64 mpich
  releases `>=5.0` (`5.0.0` and `5.0.1`), `5.0.0` fails outright at compile
  time against conda-forge's aarch64 `petsc` package (`petscsys.h` hard-errors
  on the mpi.h version mismatch). MPICH 5.0.1 itself has an open, observed bug
  on aarch64 where real PETSc/hypre solves (BoomerAMG preconditioning) can
  abort with `MPI_Allreduce() function was called before MPI_INIT was
  invoked` (exit code 14) -- see the comment header in
  `environment-mpich-dev.yml` for the reproduction and verification details.
  If you hit this, switch to `environment-openmpi-dev.yml`.

On macOS/arm64 (Apple Silicon) the choice is not free: conda-forge's `scorec`
package has **mpich-only builds** on that platform, so `scorec >=4.2.1` can never
resolve against a forced OpenMPI and `environment-openmpi-dev.yml` is
unsatisfiable there by construction. Use `environment-mpich-dev.yml` on Apple
Silicon. (The cause is a `skip:` in conda-forge's scorec-feedstock, added because
OpenMPI's `mpicxx` is a real binary that cannot execute during the osx-arm64
cross-compile; conda-forge/scorec-feedstock#32 removes it, after which OpenMPI
becomes available there too.)

On x86_64, both files should resolve equally well and neither known issue
above has been observed; OpenMPI remains the recommended default there too
for consistency.

## pip

Proteus is not a pure-Python package: most of it is C/C++/Cython/Fortran
extensions linking against PETSc, MPI, HDF5, SuperLU/SuperLU_DIST,
METIS/ParMETIS, and BLAS/LAPACK. All of that can be provisioned with pip
alone (no conda, no system package manager beyond a C/C++/Fortran compiler
and `make`) using PETSc's own `--download-x` configure options, exposed to
its PyPI package via the `PETSC_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` environment variable.
This builds everything from source, so expect it to take a while.

The recipe below also builds Chrono (multibody/FSI) and PUMI (mesh
adaptation) via PETSc's `--download-chrono`/`--download-pumi` (plus their
own extra dependencies: `--download-eigen` for Chrono, `--download-zoltan`
for PUMI). PUMI's build additionally needs `libbz2`'s development
package on the system already (Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libbz2-dev`;
most systems already have the runtime `libbz2` library but not its
link-time `.so` symlink, which is what's actually needed here). If you'd
rather skip one or both (e.g. to avoid that extra build time, or if you
can't install `libbz2-dev`), set `PROTEUS_SKIP_PUMI=1` and/or
`PROTEUS_SKIP_CHRONO=1` (or `PROTEUS_SKIP_PUMI_CHRONO=1` for both at once)
before the final `pip install` step below, and drop the corresponding
`--download-x` options above it.

Three pip flags matter throughout this section, and they are about
correctness rather than tidiness:

- **`--no-build-isolation`** for anything that links the native stack
  (`petsc4py`, `h5py`, `proteus` itself). Build isolation gives the build a
  throwaway environment and re-fetches build dependencies from PyPI, so it does
  not see -- and will happily rebuild -- the PETSc/HDF5/MPI you just installed.
  This is why the build dependencies are installed up front instead.
- **`--no-cache-dir`** for those same installs. pip's locally-built wheel cache
  is keyed on the requirement URL, its hash, and the interpreter name/version --
  and *nothing* about the native libraries the wheel linked against. So an
  `h5py` wheel built earlier against a different HDF5 is a cache hit here and
  gets reused silently. Note `--no-binary` does not protect against this: it
  blocks prebuilt wheels from PyPI, not pip's own cached builds of your sdists.
- **`--no-binary <pkg>`**, scoped per package -- *not* `:all:`. Only the
  packages that link this stack must be built from source (`h5py`, `petsc4py`,
  `mpi4py`); h5py's own wheels in particular bundle a private serial HDF5, which
  silently costs you parallel I/O (`can't use mpio driver`). Using `:all:` would
  also drag numpy, scipy and cmake into source builds for no correctness gain.

```bash
python -m venv proteus-env && source proteus-env/bin/activate
# setuptools: needed by the final --no-build-isolation step below, which
# uses the active venv's own packages rather than an isolated sandbox.
# scipy: several of proteus's own modules (BoundaryConditions, SpatialTools)
# import it directly. pybind11 is pinned: xtensor-python 0.28.0's
# xt::pyarray<T> doesn't compose with pybind11 3.x's reworked class
# hierarchy ("member 'operator*=' found in multiple base classes of
# different types" when proteus's mprans kernels use xt::pyarray); 2.13.6
# is the last known-good 2.x line.
pip install --no-cache-dir cython "pybind11==2.13.6" wheel numpy \
    "cmake>=3.29" setuptools scipy pkgconfig
# mpi4py from source: its PyPI wheels are built against one MPI's ABI, and
# MPICH's and Open MPI's are not interchangeable (MPI_Comm is `int` on MPICH and
# a pointer on Open MPI), so a wheel can import against the wrong libmpi.
pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary mpi4py mpi4py

# xtensor/xtl/xtensor-python aren't in upstream PETSc (proteus's plan is to
# drop this dependency; until then, install from our fork instead of PyPI's
# own `petsc` package, since only this fork's PETSc knows about them).
# --download-cmake: PETSc's own configure can't see the cmake pip just
# installed above from inside its build-isolation sandbox.
# --download-hypre: several of proteus's own solver tests configure
# pc_type=hypre; without this they fail with "PCSetType(): Unknown type".
# --download-eigen/--download-zoltan: required by --download-chrono/
# --download-pumi respectively, not optional once those are requested.

# Only needed if your system's mpicc doesn't put mpi.h somewhere proteus's
# own build already looks (get_flags('mpi') in proteus/config/default.py
# expects $MPI_DIR/include/mpi.h specifically). Most OpenMPI/Homebrew
# installs already have mpi.h under a plain <prefix>/include, so deriving
# MPI_DIR as the parent of mpicc's own -I flag (the dirname below) works
# directly. Debian/Ubuntu's mpich package does NOT follow that layout --
# its mpi.h lives at a multiarch-nested path like
# /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/mpich/mpi.h, which has no plain
# "<prefix>/include" ancestor at all; naively taking dirname() of that
# points MPI_DIR at a directory whose own include/mpi.h doesn't exist,
# and proteus's build fails with "fatal error: mpi.h: No such file or
# directory" partway through (confirmed on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04 with
# the distro's own mpich package). Detect which layout you're in and, for
# the nested case, build a small symlink shim so $MPI_DIR/include/mpi.h
# resolves correctly either way:
_mpi_inc=$(mpicc -show | grep -o '\-I[^ ]*' | head -1 | cut -c3-)
if [ "$(basename "$_mpi_inc")" = "include" ]; then
  export MPI_DIR=$(dirname "$_mpi_inc")
else
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.proteus_mpi_dir"
  ln -sf "$_mpi_inc" "$HOME/.proteus_mpi_dir/include"
  ln -sf "$(mpicc -show | grep -o '\-L[^ ]*' | head -1 | cut -c3-)" "$HOME/.proteus_mpi_dir/lib"
  export MPI_DIR="$HOME/.proteus_mpi_dir"
fi
# $PETSC_DIR/bin needs to stay on PATH after this point too, not just for
# the build below -- it's where the `triangle` CLI
# --download-triangle-build-exec=1 built lives, and some of proteus's own
# tests shell out to it.
export PATH="$PETSC_DIR/bin:$PATH"
pip install --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir --no-deps .
```

If your PETSc is already built (e.g. by an HPC site, or you don't need
xtensor and can use PyPI's own `petsc` package directly), skip straight to
the `petsc4py`/`h5py`/proteus steps with `PETSC_DIR` (and `PETSC_ARCH`, if
set) pointing at that install; `PETSC_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` is only consulted
when `petsc4py`'s own install triggers a fresh PETSc build.

If PyPI does not have gmsh and you want to use or run tests with gmsh, get
it from elsewhere, (e.g. from the gmsh website or conda).

This path is new and less battle-tested than the conda/mamba route above and the PETSc BuildSystem/HPC routes below -- if something here breaks, those are
the more mature fallbacks.

## Spack

[Spack](https://spack.io) builds proteus and its native dependency chain
(PETSc, MPI, HDF5, SuperLU, METIS/ParMETIS, xtensor, and optionally
PUMI) from source, with no conda and no system package manager
beyond a C/C++/Fortran compiler. `py-proteus` isn't in spack-packages
`develop` yet; until it's merged, add it from the `py-proteus` branch of
https://github.com/cekees/spack-packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
git clone -b py-proteus https://github.com/cekees/spack-packages.git
spack repo add spack-packages/repos/spack_repo/builtin

spack install py-proteus            # Chrono and PUMI both disabled
spack install py-proteus+pumi       # adds PUMI (SCOREC/core) mesh adaptation
spack load py-proteus
```

Chrono has no upstream Spack package yet and stays disabled either way;
`+pumi` adds `pumi`, `zoltan`, and `parmetis` for mesh adaptation. Like
the pip path above, this one is new -- fall back to conda/mamba or HPC
`--download-proteus` if something here breaks.

## HPC (PETSc BuildSystem)

For installation on high performance environments, the recommended path is
PETSc's own build system, which most HPC sites and module systems already
support: `git@gitlab.com:cekees/petsc.git`, branch `download-proteus-support`,
adds a `--download-proteus` PETSc package (plus PETSc packages for proteus's
optional native dependencies: chrono, pumi, xtensor) so a single
`./configure` + `make` builds PETSc, proteus, and everything in between,
instead of the separate per-dependency manual build this section used to describe. You will need a user-installable prefix directory, which below is assumed to be a conda environment, but a Python venv should also work.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:cekees/petsc.git
cd petsc
git checkout download-proteus-support
CONDA_PREFIX=/path/to/your/conda/env PREFIX=/path/to/install ./configure_macos_arm64.sh   # macOS/arm64
make PETSC_DIR="$(pwd)" PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-download-proteus all
make PETSC_DIR="$(pwd)" PETSC_ARCH=arch-darwin-download-proteus install
```

On Linux (x86_64 or aarch64/ARM64), use `configure_linux_unified.sh`
instead, which downloads and builds its own MPI/OpenBLAS/CMake straight
into the same prefix rather than expecting an externally-supplied conda
env to provide them — the toolchain env only needs to supply Python
(+numpy) and a C/C++/Fortran compiler:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:cekees/petsc.git
cd petsc
git checkout download-proteus-support
PREFIX=/path/to/install ./setup_env_miniforge.sh   # minimal, throwaway Python env
CONDA_PREFIX=/path/to/install PREFIX=/path/to/install PETSC_PREFIX=/path/to/install \
  ./configure_linux_unified.sh
make PETSC_DIR="$(pwd)" PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-download-proteus all
make PETSC_DIR="$(pwd)" PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-download-proteus install
```

(A plain Python venv works too in place of `setup_env_miniforge.sh` — see
`setup_env_venv.sh` — as does an already-existing conda/mamba env, in
which case skip straight to `configure_linux_unified.sh` with
`CONDA_PREFIX`/`PREFIX`/`PETSC_PREFIX` all pointing at it.)

Validated end-to-end on macOS/arm64, Linux/x86_64, and Linux/ARM64
(aarch64) — both the plain-venv and Miniforge-Python variants of the Linux
path pass proteus's full test suite cleanly, modulo a small set of already
independently-tracked numeric-tolerance and `gmsh`-packaging issues (not
install-pathway problems). If you're building on a platform other than
these three and hit trouble, that branch's `README_PROTEUS.md` and the
comments in `config/BuildSystem/config/packages/proteus.py`/`pumi.py`
are the places to start (in particular, a couple of post-install fixups in
there are known to be macOS/dyld-specific workarounds, not applicable
elsewhere).

The package definitions themselves are plain PETSc packages and don't
depend on that specific fork -- if your site already has its own PETSc
checkout, copying `config/BuildSystem/config/packages/{proteus,chrono,pumi,xtl,xtensor,xtensor-python,numpy,h5py}.py`
into it works the same way.

See https://github.com/erdc/proteus/wiki/How-to-Build-Proteus for old information on building the entire stack by hand.
