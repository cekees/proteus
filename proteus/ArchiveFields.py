"""Declaring extra fields to write into the archive.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
Adding an auxiliary field to the archive used to mean editing the generic
driver, ``NumericalSolution.py``, and the established way to do it was::

    try:
        phi_s = {}
        phi_s[0] = model.levelModelList[-1].coefficients.phi_s
        model.levelModelList[-1].archiveFiniteElementResiduals(
            self.ar[index], t, self.tCount, phi_s, res_name_base='phi_s')
        logEvent("Writing initial phi_s ...")
    except:
        pass

Eight fields were written that way, each duplicated across
``archiveInitialSolution`` and ``archiveSolution``. The pattern has four
problems:

1. ``archiveFiniteElementResiduals`` is not a residual writer. It is the
   only entry point that accepts an arbitrary DOF array, so everything
   got routed through it -- bathymetry, free-surface elevation, VOF, a
   solid-phase indicator. Its name misleads, and its ``{0: array}``
   argument is pure ceremony.
2. ``try/except: pass`` is being used as feature detection ("skip this
   field if the model doesn't have it"), but it discards *every* error in
   the block -- a shape mismatch, a failed HDF5 write, a renamed
   attribute.
3. That masking hid real bugs. ``archiveInitialSolution`` has no ``t``
   parameter, yet one of its blocks called ``str(t)``; the resulting
   ``NameError`` fired on every model that had ``coefficients.phi_s`` and
   was never seen. Worse, ``coefficients.phi_sp`` stopped existing when
   commit ``eed483b3`` replaced the nodal ``phi_sp`` field with
   quadrature-point ``q_phi_porous``. Both ``phi_sp`` blocks have been
   dead ever since -- archives written before that change contain a
   ``phi_sp0`` field and archives written after silently do not.
4. It put model-specific knowledge in the generic driver, down to
   ``if 'clsvof' in model.name:``.

How this module fixes it
------------------------
Fields are *declared where they live*, by the coefficients class that owns
them, and the driver writes them in one loop:

.. code-block:: python

    # in proteus/mprans/SW2DCV.py, class Coefficients
    def archiveFields(self, lm):
        yield ArchiveField("bathymetry", self.b.dof)
        yield ArchiveField("eta", self.b.dof + lm.u[0].dof)

.. code-block:: python

    # in NumericalSolution.py -- replaces all sixteen blocks
    model.levelModelList[-1].archiveDeclaredFields(self.ar[index], t, self.tCount)

Consequences:

- Absence is expressed as a normal ``if`` in the hook, on the class that
  knows the answer, so it no longer has to be spelled ``except: pass``.
  Everything else propagates, with the field's name in the message.
- ``TC_base.archiveFields`` yields nothing, so every existing coefficients
  class keeps working untouched.
- There is one code path, exercised by every field, so the next bug of the
  ``NameError`` kind fails on the first test run instead of hiding.
- ``center`` and ``rank`` are exactly the YMF/XDMF ``Center`` and
  ``AttributeType``, validated against closed sets, so a malformed field
  is not representable.

        share one archive (``useOneArchive``) and would otherwise collide.
    value : numpy.ndarray
        The DOF array to write. Read at write time, so a declaration may
        compute it (``self.b.dof + lm.u[0].dof``) and stay current.
    center : str
        Which mesh entity the values live on; one of :data:`CENTERINGS`.
    rank : str
        ``Scalar``, ``Vector`` or ``Tensor``; one of :data:`RANKS`.

        Carried into the archive as metadata for the YMF front-end and
        CSDMS interop. **Not validated here** -- per the campaign's trust
        boundary, semantic checking belongs to the front-end, off the
